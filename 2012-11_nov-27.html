<ul>
<li>Global declaration instantiation added, &quot;global object + lexical scope&quot; model.</li>
<li>Program is now Script</li>
<li>Set/Map size is now an accessor</li>
<li>Set/Map clear method added</li>
</ul>
<p>Notably, size is the first accessor defined by the spec.</p>
<p>DH: There will be more accessors defined in the module loader spec.</p>
<p>EA: Ensure no prototype for methods, should behave the same as spec functions.</p>
<p>AWB: Explains how the spec language is laid out for accessors, wherein &quot;get&quot; or &quot;set&quot; is prepended to the section item's title.</p>
<p>RW: (agrees that it's clear to follow)</p>
<p>AWB: This is the first rev. that brings in Proxy, which leads to the restructuring of early sections and internal methods.</p>

<a href="#meta-object-protocol-aka-mop"><h3 id="meta-object-protocol-aka-mop">Meta Object Protocol, aka. MOP</h3></a><p>Discussing section on invariants and how to redefine in a reasonable way.  We need people who are interested in these invariants to make contributions to this section.</p>
<p>8.1 Language Types
8.2 Specification Types</p>
<p>8.3-8.5 Will be moved to after section 10, these define the concrete types</p>
<p>8.3 Ordinary Object - an object that uses the standard MOP semantics in 8.3. example: Objects, Function objects</p>
<p>8.4 Exotic Objects - any object that is not an Ordinary Object, which means anything that specifies the use of something that is not in the MOP. examples: BoundFunction, Arrays, Strings</p>
<p>Standard Object - any object defined by the specification.</p>
<p>WH: why is BoundFunction exotic?</p>
<p>AWB: the special semantics of [[Call]] and [[Construct]]</p>
<p>WH: Does this mean that all built-in functions eg. Math.sin are exotic? This labeling bothers me if the user might be able to define differences between ordinary/exotic</p>
<p>LH: Why aren't all objects exotic?</p>
<p>AWB: initially set out to replace Host Objects, initially defined as anything that has redefined its internal methods</p>
<p>LH: Are there any checks, &quot;is this an exotic object&quot;?</p>
<p>AWB: No, this just simplifies and cleans up the language to that describes an object that has &quot;special&quot; semantics</p>
<p>WH: Do you identify all built-ins as exotic?</p>
<p>AWB: Reads back from Built-In descriptions in rev12</p>
<p>STH: Seems like it's simply a way to ease the pains of editing the spec.</p>
<p>AWB: [Further explanation of</p>
<p>WH: ?</p>
<p>AWB: Every algorithm in chapter 15 is the definition of the algorithms used when [[Call]]. In a situation where we need to reify concepts where we're not sure what the execution context currently is... eg. generators</p>
<p>WH: How does execution context come into this discussion</p>
<p>AWB: The spec needs to be able to discuss these semantics (gives example)</p>
<p>NL/WH: How is this observable if the implementation may or may not be provided in ECMAScript code?</p>
<p>AWB: Only need a means by which to explain the semantics.</p>
<p>I need to be able to talk about the execution context of a chapter 15 function while in a chapter 15 function algorithm</p>
<p>DH: I'm not sure this concept of an exotic object is the best way to go about this.</p>
<p>AWB: At this point we're talking about chapter 15 issues, not specifically exotic objects.</p>
<p>DH: I think this is good to signal to implementors that something different will have to occur.</p>
<p>STH: This is simply a tool to aid in the editing process.</p>
<p>DH: Not an annex, good.</p>
<p>AWB: Correct, the different semantics are grouped where they actually belong.</p>
<p>WH: I still don't understand why there is a grouping of these types of objects.</p>
<p>AWB: Please review the spec... If there are any strong arguments, please share.</p>
<p>AWB/DH: Confirm the subject matter of sections 8.3 and 8.4</p>
<p>RW: (stated prior to beginning of meeting) This change makes reading, understanding and following the varying behaviors easier to follow.</p>
<p>WH: Reading 8.4.6 and can't follow the description...</p>
<p>AWB: There are issues that exist due to prior hacks (not authored by me).</p>
<p>STH/LH: As long as this is just a spec tool, there is nothing wrong with the chosen categorizations.</p>
<p>AWB: For those of you reading the spec, please re-familiarize yourself with the new terminology.</p>
<p>LH:</p>
<p>AWB: The risk for semantic change... some methods renamed, some may have different behaviors. No change to observable semantics</p>
<p>DH: Don't remember the proto climbing refactoring</p>
<p>AWB: Tries locally, then same operation on next level. Each step up is observable via proxies.</p>
<p>DH: not web dependent</p>
<p>WH: if it's not visible, why do implementations need to change?</p>
<p>AWB: In the presence of proxies, proto climbing is visible. The difference... What [[Get]] in the old system did was loop, instead of recursion. If a prototype was a proxy, the trap would never be invoked. In the new system, it will. The property access system needed to change to support this...</p>
<p>DH: We'll get feedback from proxy implementors</p>
<p>AWB:</p>
<p>MM: There are two engine based proxy implementations, SpiderMonkey and v8—let's wait to discuss the impact.</p>
<p>BT: So there is a low risk of semantic change in 8.x? (with no regard for proxies)</p>
<p>AWB: Should be no observable semantic change and this should be confirmable with tests and reviewers.
...Will add a description of what should be observable and not.</p>
<p>Another change happening in this edition, is specifying where each exception is thrown. Previously this was implicit, but is now <strong>explicit</strong>.</p>
<p>WH/AWB: review 10.2.1.2.6 use of ReturnIfAbrupt(value)</p>
<p>LH: was there concern of ambiguity before? Seemed clear...</p>
<p>AWB: There were places where it was unclear where the the exception should be thrown, Mark had identified the loop in ??</p>
<p>...Discussion about explicit exceptions</p>
<p>DC: Need to break.</p>
<p>WH: Throw on string concat over allowed length?</p>
<p>...Discussion about ReturnIfAbrupt...</p>
<p>LH: Is this a maintainability issue? If a new leaf addition is defined that uses ReturnIfAbrupt, do you have to check all call sites?</p>
<p>AWB: The work is already done.</p>

<p>(6)
Wait</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource Bundles</li>
<li>Needs investigation</li>
<li>Maybe module system can be used?</li>
</ul>
<p>WH: How are resource bundles different from JSON?</p>
<p>NL: That's generally how they are stored, the challenge is loading the right bundle for the application's current locale</p>
<p>DH: can this be stored compressed in a binary format?</p>
<p>AWB/LH/YK: (discussion and agreement on HTML/CSS involvement in resource bundling is too browser-centric)</p>
<p>WH: Rather than providing a method that loads a bundle from some web page (which will likely clash with how a particular web server is structured), provide utilities such as decoding a bundle from a string and selecting the right bundle (e.g. the current language's) from a list of bundle names.</p>
<p>MM: Abstract the problem to a data loading issue</p>
<p>EF: Whose job is it to define the information in a resource bundle?</p>
<p>EF/NL: generally the library or application using the data has to define its structure and provide bundles for the locales it wants to support; there is an issue when third parties want to add more locales</p>

Approval?</p>
<p>JN: Who is working on this?</p>
<p>NL: First meeting had representatives from Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, Amazon.</p>
<p>JN: Will provide minutes of meetings to ECMA?</p>
<p>NC: Yes.</p>
<p>JN: Despite potential operational changes from ECMA, let's move forward with this project. Continue to report as adhoc group via this group.</p>
<a href="#conclusionresolution-internationalization-update"><h4 id="conclusionresolution-internationalization-update">Conclusion/Resolution</h4></a><p>TC39 Approves to move forward with 2.0. NL will submit slides to ECMA for minutes record.</p>
<a href="#string-normalization"><h2 id="string-normalization">String Normalization</h2></a><p><a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:unicode_normalization#add_normalize_method">http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:unicode_normalization#add_normalize_method</a></p>
<p>NL: AWB has removed a number of references to normalization from the current spec that did not reflect reality</p>
<p><strong>String.prototype.normalize(form)</strong></p>
<p>MM: Any sequence of utf-16 has a valid, specific normalization?</p>
<p>NL: Will have to check if the normalization spec has anything about unpaired surrogates.</p>
<p>MM: Either we make the function total, in the sense that it always returns a string, or total in the sense that we define where it throws exception.</p>
<p>NL/LH: (agree w/ always return a string)</p>
<p>NL: Are we in agreement to spec this?</p>
<p>MM: Requirements: (moved to resolution)</p>
<a href="#conclusionresolution-string-normalization"><h4 id="conclusionresolution-string-normalization">Conclusion/Resolution</h4></a><ul>
<li>Yes, requirements:
<ul>
<li>total,</li>
<li>deterministic</li>
<li>idempotent normalization (normalizing the result of normalization again will return the first result)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>WH: Note that Unicode got this wrong a while back (their normalization algorithm wasn't idempotent, and it didn't even form proper equivalence relations). They fixed it since then and now explicitly state that it's idempotent.</p>
<a href="#string-case-conversion"><h2 id="string-case-conversion">String Case Conversion</h2></a><p><a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:case_conversion">http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:case_conversion</a></p>
<p>LH: Why isn't this in the Internationalization standard?</p>
<p>AWB: Is there a reason this isn't in the Intl 1.0?</p>
<p>NL: Case conversion wasn't considered in original scope for Intl 1.0; we then forgot to add it when respecifying String.prototype.localeCompare and friends.</p>
<p>RW: There is a Case Conversion item in Intl 2.0, is this the same?</p>
<p>NL: Correct, but these functions are in Language spec. Should this be added to ES6?</p>
<p>AWB: Don't think that we should start moving Intl into ES, or at least not until ES7</p>
<p>NL/LH: Not being in ES6 doesn't prevent implementation or spec authoring.</p>
<p>LH: Doesn't need to be in the wrong spec just to move forward.</p>
<a href="#conclusionresolution-string-case-conversion"><h4 id="conclusionresolution-string-case-conversion">Conclusion/Resolution</h4></a><ul>
<li>Goes in Internationalization but doesn't prevent specification or implementation.</li>

<a href="#eliminate-touint32-warping-on-array-access"><h2 id="eliminate-touint32-warping-on-array-access">Eliminate ToUInt32() warping on array access</h2></a><p>AWB: Sparse parameter on Array iterator constructors (eg. Array.prototype.keys/values/items that determines whether or not &quot;holes&quot; are included in the iteration.?
Can we eliminate functions returning Reference values from the specification</p>
<p>AWB: Arrays use ToUint32, which does modulo arithmetic.</p>
<p>WH: Yes, but it doesn't actually warp indices. Ones larger than 2^32-2 are not array indices; they're not treated modulo 2^32.</p>
<p>WH: Also note that strings such as &quot;0.0&quot; and &quot;007&quot; are intentionally not array indices either, even though they're within the array range. The array index code checks that the value round-trips to a number and back to the same string; this is what keeps indices over 2^32-2 from warping.</p>
<p>MM: What are the practical benefits of this?</p>
<p>AWB: 2 Things, we could do this at 2^53 and truncate there instead of warping</p>
<p>MM: Is there a history of implementors that have worked out these issues?</p>
<p>AWB: Every new array(like) operation needs to have this behavior</p>
<p>DH: Concern that this will break the web</p>
<p>AWB: IE had a problem for a long time that went nearly unnoticed.</p>
<p>MM: strategic to postpone this cleanup until we have integers. Don't see a reason to make this change</p>
<p>DH: Concerned about code that would even have arrays this large</p>
<p>AWB: The point is to avoid craziness after 2^53</p>
<p>MM: What is the handling of the 2^53 edge condition that this change will benefit?</p>
<p>AWB: I have to review the spec and can follow up tomorrow.</p>
<p>Look at 15.4 of ES5.1, when you go over the edge, results in expand properties being set on the array. Additionally, the 2^32 edge condition:</p>

<p>The Generator Constructor doesn't need a global name. Assume it's accessible at System.Global.</p>
<p>Each generator function has a unique prototype object with own properties for next, send, throw, close, etc. These prototype types may share references to the built-in mplementations of those methods.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>But no way to test if either g1 or g2 is a generator function rather than an ordinary function.
...</p>
<p>Possible Solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make Generator a subclass of Function, allows instanceof checking (on some kind of special System object)</li>
<li>Make a global built-in Generator constructor</li>
<li>@@hasInstance(): void</li>
</ol>
<p>Anomalies...</p>
<ol>
<li>instanceof will be true for non Generator functions</li>
<li>g1.constructor === &quot;Generator&quot;?</li>
</ol>
<p>DH: If we go against the behavior of the language we'll end up with...</p>
<p>MM: Agree up until the reflective Generator</p>
<p>DH: Function creates function, Generator creates generator</p>
<p>YK: Anything other than that is pure WAT.</p>
<p>AWB: Need to get our terminology straight.</p>
<p>MM: Going forward, we've created this class system... Having Generators be a subclass...</p>
<p>lost track, sorry. Hope Mark can fill this point in later.</p>

<p>MM: Of all the things we're talking about, creating Generators reflectively is the least concern. Something like...</p>
<p>Function.makeGenerator(...); returns generator function</p>
<p>... If that was important to provide, but likely not.</p>
<p>MM/LH: Generator is a zero-arg, no-op.</p>

<p>DH/LH: (Discussion of this inside Generator)</p>
<p>MM/AWB: (Converge on diagram of inheritance relationship)</p>
<p>DH: Which parts do we surface as public API?</p>
<p>MM: Abstaining.</p>
<p>DH: Important to retain Python naming to avoid WAT. Ok with not surfacing anything to public API</p>
<p>WH: Would like to at least expose &quot;Generator&quot;. [Note: the object I was referring to got renamed to &quot;GeneratorFunction&quot; later in the discussion and further down in the notes here.]</p>
<p>DH/WH: (Disagreement on exposure of public API)</p>
<p>AWB: Need a value for .constructor</p>
<p>DH: Ok, .constructor dictates the requirement.</p>
<p>MM: Does this mean that if you call the Generator constructor with a yield?</p>
<p>AWB/RW: Error</p>
<p>??</p>
<p>DC: Are we adding Generator because it qualifies as important enough to stand on its own?</p>
<p>DH: Reflective evaluation is powerful enough to stand on its own. A huge gulf between <code>with</code></p>
<p>MM: There is no immediate benefit...</p>
<p>WH: It's easier to include then to exclude it, for spec benefit.</p>
<p>MM: Agreed, only benefit is specification symmetry.</p>
<p>WH: Function does reflection, so it makes sense.</p>
<p>MM: Consensus on exposing GeneratorFunction via some imported module?</p>
<p>All: Yes.</p>
<p>MS: Can I determine if an object is a generator function?</p>
