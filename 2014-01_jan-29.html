<a href="#function-in-blocks-in-non-strict-mode"><h2 id="function-in-blocks-in-non-strict-mode">Function in Blocks in non strict mode.</h2></a><p>(Ask Brian for slides)</p>
<p>BT: In ES6 draft in appendix B (since functions in block are not in ES5 but implemented)</p>
<p>BT: IE11 shipped with function in block in non strict mode.</p>
<p>BT: Hoists across let blocks</p>
<p>AWB: If you start using a let then you'll get an error. Since old code does not use <code>let</code>.</p>
<p>LH: If the code falls out of the known patterns you hit a rough edge and then it is better to get an error than undefined behavior.</p>
<p>WH:  Concerned about expanding past the minimal crazy intersection semantics we agreed  to in the past. The proposal expands the set of cases that produce surprise captures.</p>
<p>WH: [on whiteboard] This is not just about eliminating errors. It will silently change the meaning of working code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{ ... <span class="hljs-number">1</span> ... }
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">bar</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (...) {
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{ ... <span class="hljs-number">2</span> ... }
  }
  foo(); <span class="hljs-comment">// Thought it would refer to the outer scope foo. Surprise!</span>
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{ ... <span class="hljs-number">1</span> ... }
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">bar</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (...) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> foo =...;
    {
      <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{ ... <span class="hljs-number">2</span> ... }
    }
  }
  foo();
}
</code></pre>
<p>LH: Since 1.5% depend on the crazy behavior we have no real option.</p>
<p>WH: Let's limit the craziness to just the cases in the minimal intersection semantics.</p>
<p>BT: Allow hoisting past a let.</p>
<p>ARB: What was the motivation for this special case, i.e., why not drop all hoists that would normally be an error?</p>
<p>LH: Creates 2 bindings. The FunctionDeclaration itself mutates both the var binding and the let binding.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
  {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> foo;
    {
      <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">f</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{}  <span class="hljs-comment">// Why no error?</span>
    }
    <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(foo);  <span class="hljs-comment">// undefined</span>
  }
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(foo); <span class="hljs-comment">// funtion foo() {}</span>
})();
</code></pre>
<p>DH: If you inject a let and it shadows a var it should be a static error.</p>
<p>LH: In strict mode it is legal so it cannot be an error in non strict.</p>
<p>DH: It is consistent with a var in a block.</p>
<p>ARB: What happens if you have two functions</p>
<p>LH: You conceptually get two var bindings.</p>
<p>WH: That's not part of the intersection semantics. Shouldn't get any if you have two foo's in inner blocks.</p>
<p>YK: Writing new ES6 code in non strict should still work.</p>
<p>WH: It will silently do different and surprising things, as per examples above.</p>
<p>DH: If there is any intervening let binding do not hoist past the let.</p>
<p>LH: If introducing would introduce a static error. Do not introduce the var binding.
[Discussion on the behavior of the new var bindings, along with whether assignment to foo updates one or both.]</p>
<p>WH: When are the crazy introduced var bindings initialized? At entry to outer function bar (just like ES5 inner functions in the top-level of an outer function), or at the time the inner function function foo definition is executed?
Various: Set to undefined on entry to outer function. Set when inner function definition foo is executed.
Various: Executing function definition updates both the let and the var bindings. Assignment updates only the let binding.</p>
<p>WH: [points out (and likes) warning on cases &quot;for which the above steps are performed&quot; in Annex B of the current draft]
[Long discussion about warnings, SHOULD, and their audience]</p>
<p>LH:  A SHOULD warning seems a reasonable addition to the proposal here.</p>
<a href="#conclusionresolution-function-in-blocks-in-non-strict-mode"><h4 id="conclusionresolution-function-in-blocks-in-non-strict-mode">Conclusion/resolution</h4></a><ul>
<li>2 bindings.</li>
<li>Hoist a var binding for the FunctionDeclaration, unless it would introduce a static error (ie. hoisting past a let will not cause an error but also not create the var binding).</li>
<li>Also create a let binding as per pure (strict mode) ES6 semantics. (Change from IE11 semantics). Within the scope of the let binding, assignment will only touch the let binding (ie. normal semantics).</li>
<li>The var binding is only initialized at dynamic evaluation of function declaration.</li>
<li>A SHOULD warning if there is a reference to any such var binding of a function</li>
</ul>
<a href="#objectobserve-status-report"><h2 id="objectobserve-status-report">Object.observe Status Report</h2></a><p>RWN: Suggest moving OO to the second stage.
:: Approved</p>
<p>RWN: Wants to move OO to the third stage, which requires a spec text review.</p>
<p>YK: Has reviewed it already.</p>
<p>AWB: Might have time to review.</p>
<p>RWN: The plan is to ship OO in Chrome sometime around April.</p>
<p>AWB: Should not be a problem to advance without scrutizing the proposal. Willing to rubber stamp at this point. Since we are in a state where we are. (?)</p>
<p>YK: Once we are at stage 3 we are committed to not revisit.</p>
<p>RWS/YK to talk about task scheduling.</p>
<a href="#conclusionresolution-objectobserve-status-report"><h4 id="conclusionresolution-objectobserve-status-report">Conclusion/resolution</h4></a><p>???</p>
<a href="#post-es6-process"><h2 id="post-es6-process">Post ES6 process</h2></a><p>AWB: First step is to post the process somewhere public</p>
<p>AWB: Second, need a place to track the progress</p>
<p>AWB: Thinking we should do this on GitHub. Project TC39/meta. Master table. Or maybe 2 tables?</p>
<p>WH: Are we abandoning the wiki?
Various: yes</p>
<p>WH: How do I view HTML instead of the HTML source on GitHub?</p>
<p>EA: We should also move the meeting notes from rwaldron/* to TC39/*</p>
<p>YK: We should use the GitHub API to extract the comments for keeping the paper-trail.</p>
<p>RWN: Agenda changes since last time
1. Add a designated reviewer.
2. At step 3 and 4 there is a requirement to get an approval from the spec editor.</p>
<p>RWN: Also managing spec in flight</p>
<p>YK: I'm going to work in that.</p>
<a href="#do-expression"><h2 id="do-expression">Do Expression</h2></a><p>(Ask for slides from ARB)</p>
<p>MM: An engine can statically detect an IIFE and treat it as a do expression.</p>
<p>DS: Important to scope var declarations to the enclosing function rather than the do block because that's what happens in a do-while loop, and it's hard to tell if you're looking at a do block or a do-while loop.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> {
  ...
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span>(<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>WH, DH: Expression statements cannot start with <code>do</code> to avoid syntactic conflicts.</p>
<p>BE: Just like <code>function</code> for FunctionExression which cannot start ExpressionStatement.</p>
<p>DH: Just use a parentheses if you really need to start ExpressionStatement with <code>do</code>.</p>
<p>AWB: What step is this in the new process? Step 0?</p>
<p>ARB: Can write spec</p>
<p>DH: Primary reviewer.</p>
<a href="#conclusionresolution-do-expression"><h4 id="conclusionresolution-do-expression">Conclusion/resolution</h4></a><ul>
<li>do-expressions as generailsation of block statements</li>
<li>Progresses do-expressions to the next state in the new process.</li>
</ul>
<a href="#security-review-for-loadersrealms"><h2 id="security-review-for-loadersrealms">Security Review for Loaders/Realms</h2></a><p>MM: We have considered a security review for Loaders &amp; Realms</p>
<p>YK: Talked about this earlier, seemed positive</p>
<p>STH: Concerned about definition/scope
KR Gave vague definition</p>
<p>MM: We'd like to do the same things we did in ES5
KR Considering porting SES to ES6.
DH/
STH: this is an excellent goal</p>
<p>MM: What's the implementation status of Loaders/Realms</p>
<p>DH: Unpolyfillable, YK + DH tried some things w/ iframes, didn't work</p>
<p>DH: That's part of why we think it's a fundamental new primitive</p>
<a href="#conclusionresolution-security-review-for-loadersrealms"><h4 id="conclusionresolution-security-review-for-loadersrealms">Conclusion/Resolution</h4></a><ul>
<li>MM et al to port SES to ES6, contact module champions w/ results</li>
</ul>
<a href="#typed-objects"><h2 id="typed-objects">Typed Objects</h2></a><p>Dmitry Lomov + Niko Matsakis</p>
<p>NM: Not objects</p>
<p>WH: Likes that === compares identities, but would prefer that == compare values.</p>
<p>NM: THat would be dangerous since structs are mutable.</p>
<p>WH: In that case, how do you compare values? That's a really common thing that users will want to be able to do.</p>
<p>ARB: Accessing a sub struct of a struct does not allocate any object.</p>
<p>NM: You can stack allocate</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">Line</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> StructType({from: Point, ...})
<span class="hljs-keyword">line</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">Line</span>(...)
<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> ( ... ) {
  foo(<span class="hljs-keyword">line</span>.from)
}
</code></pre>
<p>DH: If <code>line.from</code> heap allocates it would be suprising.</p>
<p>WH: How does stack allocation work if the reference to the allocated object escapes the scope?</p>
<p>WH: Important to be able to mark StructTypes to always generate opaque fat pointers even if they don't have any 'any' field.</p>
<p>WH: This helps with optimization. Knowing that all instances of a StructType are opaque lets NaN-boxing implementations optimize out protection against NaN-injection on reads.</p>
