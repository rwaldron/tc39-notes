<p>(István on the phone discussing non-member CLA process)</p>
<p>AR: It sounds like we're making the process difficult for non-members simply because it's currently difficult for members. Can we change the goal to just make the process simpler for everyone?</p>
<p>IS: We just need the process to be the same for members and non-members. That is the current process -- we need the pdf form</p>
<p>AR: Can you take it back to the assembly(?) as a request from this TC that we'd like to simplify the process for signing the CLA to a click-through form for everyone [members and non-members]</p>
<p>IS: Yes, I can do that</p>
<p><strong>discussion</strong></p>

<li>Allen will continue to work with István on this</li>
<li>Not clear how to proceed concretely other than having members continue to push for this</li>

<p>SK: Type inferencing is hard</p>
<p>SK: JSDoc*, we need help from the user.</p>
<p>SK: Standardize JSDoc?</p>
<p>SK: JSDoc Proposal</p>
<p>AR: We are the only group that can add syntax so we should not put semantics in the comments.</p>
<p>AR: Interested in designing a type system</p>
<p>DH: I'm skeptic that we can design a type system for ES.</p>
<p>DH: Describes kinds of type systems: sound, unsound, guards</p>
<p>WH: I tried it for ES4. Came to the conclusion that a complex static type system would not work for ES's plethora of array-like things. On the other hand, more primitive type systems for things such as strings, numbers, classes are eminently doable and useful.</p>
<p>WH: I had a proposal for guards. These are more like a max min solution.</p>
<p>DH: Guards are too dynamic.</p>
<p>WH: In order for a type system to be useful, it must be enforceable in some form in order to catch erroneous or out-of-date type annotations.</p>
<p>DH: It is about as much a green field as defining a new language. It can mean so many different things.</p>
<p>JM: Would like to explore types for documentation at least.</p>
<p>DH: If there is no standard there will continue to be a proliferation of tools.</p>
<p>WH: We know this is a large space to explore. That does not mean that we should not explore it.</p>
<p>YK: If we make this a priority it will take years and years of discussion, dropping everything else.</p>
<p>BT: We can manage doing more than one thing at the same time.</p>
<p>AWB: This discussion feels like the early discussions of class syntax. Yet we were able to make progress.</p>
<p>DH: TypeScript is the strongest proposal at this point. Guards have serious problems for structural types. A sound type system (for JS) is still an academic research topic without a solution in sight.</p>
<p>YK: TS type system is incompatible with ES6.</p>
<p>YK: TS is a fork of ES5.</p>
<p>WH: These problems of incompatible forking are exactly why we need to take over this work.
f
AR: I want this for ES7</p>
<p>AWB: We haven't yet started to prioritize our next work items.</p>
<p>DH: The cost is very very high and IMO there are more important thing to work on than types.</p>
<p>WH: IMO documentable types are one of the highest priorities for us now. There is a lot of external interest as evidenced by the various external efforts.</p>
<p>BN: Strict scrutiny (e.g. from DH) can and should come before the proposal comes before TC39.</p>
<p>SK: Back to slides... Not proposing a type system. Implementors are interested in standardizing JSDoc..</p>
<p>SK: JS IDL?</p>
<p>SK: Type definition...</p>

<p>Notes that key stakeholders have signed off on this (Andy Wingo, Luke Hoban, ... others)</p>
<p><strong>DH talking about breaking out of loops and calling .return() when an abrupt exit occurs in the loop</strong></p>
<p>WH: Does a yield inside a for loop call the return method in the normal case?</p>
<p>BN: No.</p>
<p>WH: What if that yield then gets killed by a break in the caller?</p>
<p>BN: Show example.</p>
<p>WH:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> * <span class="hljs-title">a</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> x <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> y) {
    ...
    yield ...
    ...
  }
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> b <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> a()) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>** Discussing: How should abrupts inside a yield* get bubbled? **</p>
<p>BN: Any yield on which the generator (or any nested delegate generators) are currently suspended effectively become returns, so the return value &quot;bubbles&quot; all the way out to become the result of the outermost generator.</p>
<p>WH: (back to his code example) What does a's return method do?</p>
<p>MM: The break in the for loop calls the generator's return method -- causes the yield to return</p>
<p>DH: Any abrupt (but only abrupt completion) of a loop [calls .return() method?]</p>
<p>** continues through slides **
DH: Next issue: What if iterator, when given opportunity to stop, decides to keep going?
(see slides for details)</p>
<p>function* g() {
yield;
}
g = g();
g.next();
g.return(42).value === 42;</p>
<p>WH: where does the 42 passed to g's return method go?
BN: It returns out of g with 42.
WH: Is there any way for g to get at the value 42?
DH: No.</p>
<p>Brendan's Example</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>* <span class="hljs-title">gen</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{ 
  <span class="hljs-keyword">try</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">yield</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
  } <span class="hljs-keyword">finally</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">yield</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span>;
  }
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> i <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> gen()) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>;
}

<span class="hljs-comment">// The for-of loop unrolls to this:</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> g = gen();
g.next(); <span class="hljs-comment">// { value: 1, done: false }</span>
g.return(<span class="hljs-number">42</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// { value: 2, done: false }</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// Not executed because of the break from the loop:</span>
g.next(); <span class="hljs-comment">// { value: undefined, done: true }</span>
</code></pre>
<p>AWB: Important to remember that none of the costs (e.g. checking for a &quot;return()&quot; method) happen on &quot;normal&quot; completion of the loop -- only abrupt exits from the loop</p>
<p>DH: Let's talk bikeshedding: return() vs close()</p>
<p>BN: close() doesn't suggest that you can pass an argument</p>
<p>MM: .throw() is reflecting the throw construct within the generator, thus .return() makes sense</p>
<p>AWB: [strawman idea?] What about forbidding yield in try blocks?</p>
<p>RW: (silently, because I'm muted) Disagree with restricting use of <code>yield</code></p>
<p>RW: Since we have an additional six months of &quot;quality control&quot; time with the spec, should we consider dealing with this directly as part of the &quot;quality control&quot; effort? Opposed to limitations on yield in try/catch/finally.</p>
<p>AWB: that could be applied to any subject that comes up.</p>
<p>DH: forbidding yield in try blocks is a non-starter because there would then be no way to ever do any kind of cleanup on a yield using finally</p>
<p>BE: Python 2.5(?) added similar restrictions and then later relaxed them, which proves that there are use cases for yield in try-finally.</p>
<p>AWB: You'd have to structure your loop with an outer try-catch, yield takes away guarantee that finally would run</p>
<p>DH: Understand this is intended as temporary (i.e. to avoid adding complexity to generators last minute), but worst thing would be if we landed on this as a permanent semantic</p>
<p>DH: Agreement is that this is right semantics, there's a question as to whether we can get there in time</p>
<p>AWB: I worry about the precedent of adding changes like this now</p>
<p>BN: I will be happy to review the changes to chapter 25 (Generators and Promises) that are necessary to capture these changes.</p>
<p>AWB: Still worried because of the precedent this sets.</p>
<a href="#conclusionresolution-closing-iterators"><h2 id="conclusionresolution-closing-iterators">Conclusion/Resolution</h2></a><ul>
<li>Ratifying DH's proposal (&quot;proposal&quot; to be clarified), with the fallback (in case we run out of time, or decide to prioritize other work) of forbidding yield in try-finally blocks and making abrupt exits from for-of loops put the iterated-over generator into the GeneratorComplete state (which is a semantic change from leaving it in the GeneratorSuspendedYield state).</li>
</ul>
<a href="#generator-comprehensions-slides-plz"><h2 id="generator-comprehensions-slides-plz">Generator comprehensions (slides plz)</h2></a><p>Slides: <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/dherman/a-better-future-for-comprehensions">https://speakerdeck.com/dherman/a-better-future-for-comprehensions</a></p>
<p>** Basically DH is proposing deferring comprehensions to ES7 with some minor changes to future-proof **</p>
<p>let a = for (x of a1) for (y of a2) if (y &gt; x) {x,y};</p>
<p>WH: What type does this return?
?: It depends on the type of a1.
WH: Generating an array in the proposed world is ugly. If you want an array, you now need to convert the result of the comprehension to an array.</p>
<p>BE: The basis case doesn't work in the new design. To create a generator, you need to start with a generator. Awkward to write the first generator.</p>
<p>BE: problem is that a1 is evaluated eagerly rather than lazily</p>
<p>AWB: Where would we put Iterator.prototype in the Generator-related prototype object graph?
AWB: Hardest thing about this change is LAYING OUT THE DIAGRAM ALL OVER AGAIN: <a href="https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-generatorfunction-objects">https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-generatorfunction-objects</a></p>
<p>BE: Inserting a new object without populating it with any methods invites breaking changes when we do populate it with methods like .flatMap.</p>
<p>JH: Really need to go with type-directed comprehensions (letting the iterable object determine the type of the comprehension) rather than the current syntax-directed syntax: (...) and [...].</p>
<p>WH: Worried that we'll rat-hole on the new proposal, which is pie-in-the-sky with a number of identified deficiencies. The current proposal is solid. The perfect is the enemy of the good here.</p>
<a href="#conclusionresolution-generator-comprehensions-slides-plz"><h2 id="conclusionresolution-generator-comprehensions-slides-plz">Conclusion/Resolution</h2></a><ul>
<li>Defer comprehensions from ES6 to ES7 to work on the more general type-directed, method-based approach to supporting comprehensions for arbitrary iterable types (arrays, generators, streams, parallel arrays, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<a href="#71--status-update-from-dh"><h2 id="71--status-update-from-dh">7.1 <code>&lt;script type=module&gt;</code> status update (from DH)</h2></a><p>DH: Would really rather have <code>&lt;module&gt;import { foo } from &quot;bar&quot;; ...&lt;/module&gt;</code>, which is like `<script>`` but async, strict mode, has its own top-level scope, and can import declaratively (using ES6 module import syntax) from other (named) modules.</p>
<p>DH: <code>&lt;module name=&quot;qux&quot;&gt;</code> creates race conditions with HTML imports (part of WebComponents).</p>
<p>YK: People who saw named HTML module tags though you should mix html imports w named module imports
YK: When you have packaging solution (SPDY, etc), you no longer need named modules</p>
<p>MM: <code>&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;</code> would inherit the special termination rules of </script>, whereas old browsers might not handle <module> the same way, since that tag name doesn't mean anything special in old browsers</p>
<p>AR: <code>&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;</code> means the browser won't even try to parse it as JS, which is what we want [so that we can execute the script contents as a module, via some sort of polyfill]</p>
<p>DH: <code>&lt;script type=&quot;worker&quot;&gt;</code> might also need to have the <code>&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;</code> semantics, and type= attribute syntax makes it hard to mix and match those attributes; maybe <code>&lt;script worker module&gt;</code> would be better? (i.e. the type attribute values become optional value-less attribute names)</p>
<p>DH: The difference between <code>&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;</code> and <module> is that as long as there's … you always have the option of writing <code>&lt;script&gt;System.import(&quot;main.js&quot;)&lt;/script&gt;</code>
TODO: Get DH to clarify this point when we edit the notes.</p>
<p>MM: The <code>&lt;module&gt;</code> tag still has HTML misparsing consequences that <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> wouldn't have.</p>
<p>YK: The success of <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> proves that we can introduce a new <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>-like <code>&lt;module&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<p>DH: Need to create ways of doing this with pure JS, like <code>&lt;script&gt;System.import(&quot;main.js&quot;)&lt;/script&gt;</code> and then add new HTML sugar later, like <code>&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>AR: [note taker (BN) may be misinterpreting] The JS API remains important even when we have HTML sugar.</p>
